# OSSEC

OSSEC is an open source Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS). 
It has a powerful correlation and analysis engine that integrates log analysis, 
file integrity monitoring, centralized policy enforcement, rootkit detection, 
real-time alerting, and active response.

It provides a pretty complete coverage if you are looking for endpoint (server) 
monitoring.


## Installation 
If you have not used OSSEC before, I recommend reading this guide to get started:
