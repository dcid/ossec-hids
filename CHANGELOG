OSSEC dcid-fork changelog. This are the changes I have been pushing live 
to my personal OSSEC fork. It is also integrating some changes we have done
for Sucuri's internal use.

Every few months we create a stable release with these changes mostly for
internal use, but it is open for anyone to get as well.

Changes on Development branch
   * Bug fix: Missing option on agent-auth help message and authentication.
   * Feature: Logentries integration.
   * Bug fix: Memory leak on read-alert (affecting maild, client-syslog and 
     integratord).


Changes with 2016-04
   * Feature: Added a default temp (shared) password for os_authd
   * Feature: Added detection of outdated CMSs on rootcheck: WordPress,
     Joomla & Drupal.
   * Feature: Added geoip change alerts by default on SSHD/WordPress rules.
   * Feature: Added signatures to detect Darkleech, Cdorked and some common
     web backdoors and linux malware.
   * Feature: Added option to negate a pattern when using the OSMatch
     library. Usage of ! at the beginning of the pattern will change the
     behavior to return true when not found. Useful when writing subrules
     when something is not present on the log.
   * Bug fix: Glob() implementation on logcollector. Was very very slow if
     you have a few hundred entries.
   * Bug fix: Rootcheck sigs causing false positives on cpanel servers.
   * Bug fix: Finding right OpenSSL path on Debian.
     

Changes with 2016-02
   * Feature: Added different_geoip and different_srcip rule types.
   * Feature: Started to properly track the different_* usage so all
     logs have to be different.
   * Feature: Added sshd rules using different_geoip to track some
     types of behaviour anomalies.
   * Feature: Added rules to flag on shellshock activity.
   * Feature: Added frequency option to logcollector commands. 
     You can now specify hourly, or daily or any number of seconds.
   * Feature: Added libgeoip from MaxMind by default and changed 
     installation script to auto download the latest DB from them.
   * Bug fix: Multiple signatures cleanup and more sane defaults chosen.
